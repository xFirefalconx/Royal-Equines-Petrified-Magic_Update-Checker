Version [0.1b03] [05.15.2023]

WARNING! If you are upgrading, make a "/backup snapshot [filenameHere]" in-game BEFORE you upgrade.
Villages: Special caution. If you have a halfway chunk loaded village, please reveal it entirely BEFORE proceeding! Things might break otherwise. Rule of thumb is to expand until you see neither new buildings nor pathways.

New mods added.

Currently there is an issue with Hopper+ and Canary. Bug report pending. Custom Quests is not supported for 1.18.2 yet, so we gotta wait patiently. Others see below.

 
**Performance mods**

Fastload Reforged
Modernfix
LazyDFU
BetterFPSDist
Rubidium
Canary
Starlight - deactivate this mod if your light level based monster farms don't work correctly, it might increase performance issues concerning lighting, though! Alternatively replace any slab blocks with full blocks.

We might still see a longer startup time, that's because the Modpack grew a bunch since V[0.1b02]! Also, the background is now... Slightly off scale. I'm sorry this is just temporary :-< I hope, at least.

 
**Expansion mods**

Open Loader + including a new folder for modpack resources (custom tips WIP).
Seamless loading screen - displays how your world looked like when you last left the game (restart client if it doesn't work).
Better Title Screen - some Modpack info (might be replaced in the future)

**Added Shaderpack(s)**

Complementary Reimagined - there might still be blocks that don't behave how they should. Find a leaf/grass block that is off? Press F3 and send me the item tag + a screenshot of the object. I might not be able to fix everything, as some blocks behave in an... inconvenient way. Let me know if you prefer wrong movement or wrong shading. (Wish I could fix this myself but I can't :') )

 
**Added Resourcepacks**

Kitchenfloorfix.zip
A resource pack to mend a compatibility bug between FramedBlocks and the 1.18 version of CookingForBlockheads concerning kitchen tiles. Warm thanks to XFactHD and BlayTheNinth for resolving/helping to resolve this issue and giving me additional guidance to mend the bug this way. Sounds are not working sadly, live with carpet-y floor tiles.

Mod Replacements

Astikor Carts [Horse Carts] -> Astikor Carts [Horse Carts][PigCrash Fix][Fork] (by myself, xDonnervogelx)
Reason: Astikor Carts is incompatible with a bunch of mods because of a line of code that... deletes something I don't understand, causing the error message: "Failed to create entity minecraft:pig". The TFC fork of Astikor Carts dev Verph found a fix that I forked from to mend the issue on the original mod. I had to upload it as a new mod and thus we cannot use the original fork of AstikorCarts anymore. In case that pau101 sees my changes and updates the main repository and publishes the mod for 1.18.2, I will restore our reference back to the original mod, but until then we will use this one. There is a chance that your old items from AstikorCarts are not transferred when changing this mod to my version, though I took utmost care and only changed two scripts (mainly the mod version and name and the conflicting function). I can possibly not fix any other issues (I am trying to fix the config not working though, no promises) as... I don't know Java well enough. I'm sorry about that. I did the best I could here so let's just hope it'll be no huge problem for us whatsoever.

 
Mods that will be removed in the future

Merge Enchantments
Universal Enchants
Reason: [BEM] Ultimate Enchantment Management that used to be Better Mending will fully replace their functionality.
Your world will possibly not see any effects. Save a backup just to be sure.
Depending on incompatibilities, I will also consider to remove other mods in the future, we'll see how it goes.

 
Config updates

BLS -> DLS
FancyMenu
Deactivated a mod config overlay in Main Menu, for cosmetic reasons.
Barista
Better Compatibility Checker
Better title screen
AdaptivePerformanceTweaks - player
Others (possibly just minor changes)

 
Other future changes
I plan to add 2-3 mods that are unrelated to the rest of mods to enhance a few things. I yet don't know whether I'll be able to only backport the frogs and allays from 1.19, without the monsters or biome alteration, so I will need more time to figure things out. I'm also working on a mod port from 1.7.x to 1.18.2 which is quite a headache, on top of the AC fix that still doesn't work with the config because... eh issues.
KubeJS and LootJS will be very likely added NEXT update, as well as SWEM! Yes it's finally time for me to prepare the big update (hah as if this one was smol).
Since some things in SWEM will require new chunk generation, please don't venture too far or you'll have to travel a good while until you find the ores you'll need to level up your horses.
Depending on where else I'll hit a wall and lose my teeth trying to fix the issue, it'll take a bit before I can update again. I'll be working on it, don't you worry. I just take a bit of time that's all. In doubt, I have to change things again and cry in a corner, lmao. Just kidding (hopefully).
