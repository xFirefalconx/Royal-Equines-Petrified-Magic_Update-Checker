Version [0.1b02]

Moved .README.txt and .TUTORIAL.txt to a designated folder so it doesn't get removed during development.

Relocated a replaced mod that caused issues on CF side.
Better Mending - Quilt/Fabric/Forge now is Better Mending - Forge.
Changed BM config, Mending is now obtainable in Enchantment Table.
Special thanks to TheOneWithBlueEyes for the reupload.

Adjustments and further testing to ensure there is no compatibility issue at the current point in time. For more details on changes, view Changelog V[0.1b01]. View initial changelog for known issues.
