Re-Activated Mods

Better Mending is now [BEM] Better Mending Reworked. Thanks to TheOneWithBlueEyes for your hard work. 



Inactive Mods (Aka I either wait for an update or implement them in the next update, instead.)

Hopper+ (Canary incompatibility)
Custom Quests (Waiting for Update)
Better Loading Screen (Waiting for Mod rewrite, thanks to Shedaniel for working on it) -> DLS is installed only to keep the BG implemented that I worked on, it will be removed later, once BLS is back up. Sorry.
Real Time Mod (Waiting for option to globally disable day/night cycle synch and just work with day/month/year instead)
JER Integration - crash with... create? 
Villager Workers (I think about removing it entirely. It doesn't work how I thought it would.)
Spice of Life: Carrot Edition (Apple pie replaces this mod, will keep it in there if things don't work out for some reason.)
Better Tags (Development tool, activate if you are helping with debugging)



Mod Replacements

<empty>


Mods that will be removed in the future

Verdure *might* be removed if the planned overhaul will not release/backport for 1.18.2. I will see to it which way is the smallest inconvenience for everybody. 
Villager Workers (if you still want to use this mod in the future, you'll need to add it back to the package in the future. You can open up a vote issue on my CF page if you are against the removal, I'll decide based on your contributions.)



Config Updates

Better Mending Reworked
CraftPresence
Fancy Menu
XPFromHarvest (added SWEM crops)
Xtra Arrows
FTB Backups now keep at least 5GB space free on hard drives to not block other software from using the necessary space.
Verdure - Changed huge inconvenience when growing trees on Rich Soil. This is just a band aid. Please also check the other changes. Your worlds may not generate smooth dirt patches and the like because many issues happen when trying to deactivate the mod. I'm very sorry, currently I cannot do but help you patch the holes while limiting the damage done. Use the Hole Filler mod to your convenience!
KubeJS - Added shapeless recipes for otherwise unobtainable crop seeds due to cutting board not compatible with Polymorph. If you need Eggplant seeds, I hope this makes things easier.
Rebound Quark function "Hotbar Swapper" to Z instead of Y. 
If your settings weren't overwritten, double-check in your "controls > key binds" settings.
Apotheosis - Cranked down the reed growth. Might be adjusted again in the future. 

[DEVNOTES]

Shaderpack Config Updates

Added to shader list: 
swem:timothy_plant swem:oat_plant swem:alfalfa_plant 
and others
As always, if you find objects that don't move in the wind as they should, press F3 and send me the item name!



Functionality additions

Added a button to open up your changelog folder. Convenient, eh? 
Added a guide to help the strugglers out there. It'll be filled with more pages over time. 
Added the first story piece. A mysterious letter. 
Added a button to hide the news splashes if that's too annoying. Gotcha. 
Added a button to report bugs. Opens up the modpack issue page on Curseforge. 
Added a button to send feedback. Opens up the modpack comment page on Curseforge.



Other future changes
Mod updates! Hopefully more bugfixes. Maybe a few new mods, depending on what the devs hold in store. 
Story! Hopefully also quests. Still waiting on a port for 1.18.2 on a mod that caught my eye. Might not happen so I gotta see what I can do here. More visual enhancements! More? I'll let you know in the next update!
