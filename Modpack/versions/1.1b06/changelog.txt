Version [1.1b06] [11.17.2023]

[RESOLVED!] Debugging missing files on debug side? 
[This might not affect you. Let me know if your ".README.TUTORIALS" folder happens to be missing, still/again.]

New mods added.

MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod - I'm sorry I'm a collectaholic. 
GraveStone Mod - [Corail Tombstone deactivated until further notice] - This mod might get replaced by Corail Tombstone, but it's bugged with Chunk by Chunk atm so I picked a simple "Don't lose your stuff anymore" solution. I watched some of you nuggets lose tons of stuff because you died too frequently. RIP. Hopefully no more now! Whether we can have Corail some day, depends on the mod devs. Let's hope for the best!

[Testing: IN PROGRESS]

Tree breeding - breed special tree kinds if you look for a specific kind. Not compatible with all mods.

Biomes O' Bark - same as the mod above!

Diagonal Windows - oh no she did it again
Dynmap - this only works on servers, not clients. use Journeymap's webmap function for client side. (Deactivated because it crashes. No clue why so.)

Re-Activated Mods

<empty>



Inactive Mods (Aka I either wait for an update or implement them in the next update, instead.)

Hopper+ (Canary incompatibility)
Custom Quests (Waiting for Update)
Better Loading Screen (Waiting for Mod rewrite, thanks to Shedaniel for working on it) -> DLS is installed only to keep the BG implemented that I worked on, it will be removed later, once BLS is back up. Sorry.
Real Time Mod (Waiting for option to globally disable day/night cycle synch and just work with day/month/year instead)
JER Integration - crash with... create? 
Villager Workers (I think about removing it entirely. It doesn't work how I thought it would.)
Spice of Life: Carrot Edition (Apple pie replaces this mod, will keep it in there if things don't work out for some reason.)
Better Tags (Development tool, activate if you are helping with debugging)



Mod Replacements

<empty>


Mods that will be removed in the future

Verdure *might* be removed if the planned overhaul will not release/backport for 1.18.2. I will see to it which way is the smallest inconvenience for everybody. 

**! REMOVED !**: 
Villager Workers (if you still want to use this mod in the future, you'll need to add it back to the package. You can open up a vote issue on my CF page if you are against the removal, I'll decide based on your contributions.)



Config Updates

Dynamic Surroundings: Disabled Auroras/entity Breath as they are suspected to cause an ominous crash summed up with "java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "net.minecraft.client.renderer.ShaderInstance.m_173350_(String, Object)" because "$$13" is null" - if you still experience this specific crash, send me crash and latest log of the relevant timespan. 
Regrowth - removed villagers cutting grass (deleted "c" in command)
XPFromHarvest - added brown and red level 3 mushroom colony to give you XP. Enjoy!
Chunk by Chunk - set nether sync to true. If you want to reset your Nether generation, navigate to your saves>worldnamehere> and delete the "DIM-1" folder (DIM1 is The End). You cannot do that while in your world, Main Menu should work, though. That will not change the biomes that would spawn at their exact place, though. 
KubeJS - added compatibility between two bark mods and farmer's delight!
BYG Updates
Fast(Work)bench.cfg - re-enabled recipe book
Adjusted Sodium graphics settings to be suited for lower end machines (this doesn't make it require less RAM, just decrease the amount/severity of lags!) Disable shaders/3D resource packs for further performance boost.
Small jei-client.ini adjustments.
Added "swpm-server.toml" to defaultconfigs. Edit to your liking in your own worlds. Existing worlds don't get overwritten by this, check them manually.
ding.toml - Added "Ding!" sound of horse idle. 

[DEVNOTES]
BetterTitleScreen 1.1b06
BetterCompatibilityChecker 1.1b06
Modpack Update Checker repo 1.1b06
[done]



Shaderpack Config Updates

Added to shader list: 
Serene Shrubbery support
Unexplored Regions support [currently incomplete]
Gardenaganza support

As always, if you find objects that don't move in the wind as they should, press F3 and send me the item name (except snow because snow is..... yeh.)!



Functionality additions

Added prototype for playstyle choice layout (mac OS/Linux users: I am not sure if this works for you. DM me if you got problems.) (If anybody again deletes mods because of the main mechanic, petrification, good luck but your game is incompatible with your friends'. Learn from your mistakes and just disable it in the config. Why do people play a pack that is supposed to make things grindy and then disable the grind? Well, either way, ungrind your world if you so desire. Just do it PROPERLY by using the new GUI. I warned you hereby.)
Changed UI slightly to fit to new mods (MineTogether, mainly)
Starter's Guide got new pages, imagery and explanations. Wooh picture book for all who are 2 lazy 2 read. >_> I am not looking at you, lemon. Not at all. (I mean a certain lemon, not all lemons. May the citrus fruit be with you precious nuggets.)
Added a Special Thanks page. There are bugs, as always. We're very insect friendly here.
I drew new nightly Splash BGs. Enjoy! 
New button to reach Notes mod easier and without a hotkey!
Added button to survival and creative inventory to change JEI settings as a temporary fix for Configured not working properly. USE WITH CAUTION. 


Known issues

Nav Buttons in Beginners' Guide don't work like they should. I'm annoyed so I'll fix it later. Or never, idk. 
Minecraft wooden chest is not pickable by CarryOn (carryon-1.18.2-1.17.1.12), other chest should be fine, though.
Sometimes blocks don't render anymore (due to unknown reasons), leave the world and re-join it should be fixed. 
The music from 1,000,000 times might still play in main menu. Try to go back and forth to its GUI to fix it. 
XPFromHarvest doesn't work on some crops - I am still trying to debug this. Reach out if you got time and want to help me. 
SoulKeys teleport you... and then crash. I've reported this already.
There's a randomly occuring crash noticeable by a sudden game freeze and a following "Disconnect" issue that brings you to the Multiplayer screen. No idea where it stems from, something about entity ticking. Just reload your world when you're back in Main Menu, it's inconvenient but at least it doesn't completely crash Minecraft. Find it too annoying? Help me investigate. Send me crash- and latest logs, describe the situation, you know the drill. 
Some tags are cooked, seems like I left the skillet too long on the stove. Whoops.
And maaaybe the KubeJS scripts are not working correctly. I'm on it. 


Other future changes
Mod updates! Hopefully more bugfixes. Maybe a few new mods, depending on what the devs hold in store. 
Story! Hopefully also quests. Still waiting on a port for 1.18.2 on a mod that caught my eye. Might not happen so I gotta see what I can do here. More visual enhancements! More? I'll let you know in the next update!
