[This might not affect you. Let me know if your ".README.TUTORIALS" folder happens to be missing, still/again.]

(Where did my old log from December go? Well... let's write a new one \(-_-)/ *dies inside* Ahem. Due to this, I'll rearrange my changelogs a little for better readability - hope you like it!)

AntiGhost - No ghostbusters but block revealers! Actually, it just syncs the server/client better.
AntiXray - Sorry buddy, but play fair - ask the server admins if you can use cheats or suffer. You can deactivate this mod together and on your own server if you are ok with Xraying.

Async Locator - Async is cool. Servers can do other tasks in the meantime, reducing lag!

fix GPU memory leak - in case your GPU does wonky stuff

xali's Potions [needs CITResewn-1.1.1.jar for 1.18.2, I will try to implement it but since it's not uploaded on Curseforge, it might be denied. Fingers crossed! Otherwise, download it from the Rubidium Discord server!]

ChirpNoMore_Resources - This pack replaces some (imho annoying) sounds, feel free to look inside the folder to investigate. If you don't want these sounds overwritten, remove them from the folder.

CAUTION REGARDING RESOURCE PACK MANAGEMENT!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[WARNING!] .ogg files are difficult and slow to move/remove/change on Windows 10/11. 
[WARNING!] Removing resource packs from the active stack in-game is also not advised - YOUR PC MIGHT FREEZE ENTIRELY IF YOU TRY TO RELOAD RESOURCE PACKS ON RUNTIME!!! 
***I hereby WARNED you!*** SAVE ANY FILES YOU MIGHT LOSE (open documents, open projects, other) *IF* *AND* *BEFORE* ATTEMPTING ANYTHING IN MINECRAFT!
Change the resource packs at YOUR OWN RISK!!! - If Curseforge adds an out of game editor, this might be a soon to be removed worry. NOT IN SIGHT YET.

Re-Activated Mods

<empty>



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inactive Mods (Aka I either wait for an update or implement them in the next update, instead.)

Hopper+ (Canary incompatibility)
Custom Quests (Waiting for Update)
Better Loading Screen (Waiting for Mod rewrite, thanks to Shedaniel for working on it) -> DLS is installed only to keep the BG implemented that I worked on, it will be removed later, once BLS is back up. Sorry.
Real Time Mod (Waiting for option to globally disable day/night cycle synch and just work with day/month/year instead)
Spice of Life: Carrot Edition (Apple pie replaces this mod, will keep it in there if things don't work out for some reason.)
Better Tags (Development tool, activate if you are helping with debugging)
Connected Textures Mod (Crash when pressing R in JEI https://github.com/Chisel-Team/ConnectedTexturesMod/issues/227)
GraveStone Mod (Alternative for Corail Tombstone)
Dynmap (Incompatibilities + Serverside, should we remove this? TODO)
ForgetMeChunk (Waiting for Update to fix memory leak)
Dual Riders (Is this actually necessary or does unordinary basics already ship the function? TODO)



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mod Replacements

<empty>



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mods that will be removed in the future

Verdure *might* be removed if the planned overhaul will not release/backport for 1.18.2. I will see to it which way is the smallest inconvenience for everybody. 

**! REMOVED !**: 
Villager Workers (if you still want to use this mod in the future, you'll need to add it back to the package. You can open up a vote issue on my CF page if you are against the removal, I'll decide based on your contributions.)



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Config Updates

Dynamic Surroundings: Disabled Auroras/entity Breath as they are suspected to cause an ominous crash summed up with "java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "net.minecraft.client.renderer.ShaderInstance.m_173350_(String, Object)" because "$$13" is null" - if you still experience this specific crash, send me crash and latest log of the relevant timespan. 
Regrowth - removed villagers cutting grass (deleted "c" in command)
XPFromHarvest - added brown and red level 3 mushroom colony to give you XP. Enjoy!
Chunk by Chunk - set nether sync to true. If you want to reset your Nether generation, navigate to your saves>worldnamehere> and delete the "DIM-1" folder (DIM1 is The End). You cannot do that while in your world, Main Menu should work, though. That will not change the biomes that would spawn at their exact place, though. 
KubeJS - added compatibility between two bark mods and farmer's delight!
BYG Updates
Fast(Work)bench.cfg - re-enabled recipe book
Adjusted Sodium graphics settings to be suited for lower end machines (this doesn't make it require less RAM, just decrease the amount/severity of lags!) Disable shaders/3D resource packs for further performance boost.
Small jei-client.ini adjustments.
Added "swpm-server.toml" to defaultconfigs. Edit to your liking in your own worlds. Existing worlds don't get overwritten by this, check them manually.
ding.toml - Added "Ding!" sound of horse idle. 
BadMobs enabling Magpies spawn again. 
Edited Dynamic Surroundings keybind for sound settings to num lock key. 

[DEVNOTES]
[todo]
BetterTitleScreen 1.1b06
BetterCompatibilityChecker 1.1b06
Modpack Update Checker repo 1.1b06
ITLT config 1.1b06
[done]



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shaderpack Config Updates

Added to shader list: 
Serene Shrubbery support
Unexplored Regions support [currently incomplete]
Gardenaganza support

As always, if you find objects that don't move in the wind as they should, press F3 and send me the item name (except snow because snow is..... yeh.)!



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functionality additions

Added prototype for playstyle choice layout (mac OS/Linux users: I am not sure if this works for you. DM me if you got problems.) (If anybody again deletes mods because of the main mechanic, petrification, good luck but your game is incompatible with your friends'. Learn from your mistakes and just disable it in the config. Why do people play a pack that is supposed to make things grindy and then disable the grind? Well, either way, ungrind your world if you so desire. Just do it PROPERLY by using the new GUI. I warned you hereby.)
Changed UI slightly to fit to new mods (MineTogether, mainly)
Starter's Guide got new pages, imagery and explanations. Wooh picture book for all who are 2 lazy 2 read. >_> I am not looking at you, lemon. Not at all. (I mean a certain lemon, not all lemons. May the citrus fruit be with you precious nuggets.)
Added a Special Thanks page. There are bugs, as always. We're very insect friendly here.
I drew new nightly Splash BGs. Enjoy! 
New button to reach Notes mod easier and without a hotkey!
Added button to survival and creative inventory to change JEI settings as a temporary fix for Configured not working properly. USE WITH CAUTION. 



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known issues

Nav Buttons in Beginners' Guide don't work like they should. I'm annoyed so I'll fix it later. Or never, idk. 
Minecraft wooden chest is not pickable by CarryOn (carryon-1.18.2-1.17.1.12), other chest should be fine, though.
Sometimes blocks don't render anymore (due to unknown reasons), leave the world and re-join it should be fixed. 
The music from 1,000,000 times might still play in main menu. Try to go back and forth to its GUI to fix it. 
XPFromHarvest doesn't work on some crops - I am still trying to debug this. Reach out if you got time and want to help me. 
[DEVNOTES MIGHT BE FIXED!!!!!!!!!!!!]There's a randomly occuring crash noticeable by a sudden game freeze and a following "Disconnect" issue that brings you to the Multiplayer screen. No idea where it stems from, something about entity ticking. Just reload your world when you're back in Main Menu, it's inconvenient but at least it doesn't completely crash Minecraft. Find it too annoying? Help me investigate. Send me crash- and latest logs, describe the situation, you know the drill. 
Some tags are cooked, seems like I left the skillet too long on the stove. Whoops.
And maaaybe the KubeJS scripts are not working correctly. I'm on it. 



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other future changes
Mod updates! Hopefully more bugfixes. Maybe a few new mods, depending on what the devs hold in store. 
Story! Hopefully also quests. Still waiting on a port for 1.18.2 on a mod that caught my eye. Might not happen so I gotta see what I can do here. More visual enhancements! More? I'll let you know in the next update!
